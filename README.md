CSET 120 Final Project: Fusion Feast

This project's goal was to create a website template for a fictional restaurant that had to meet certain requirements dictated by our course's teacher. This project was completed by Jonathan Rathman, Srijana Thapa, and Adam Abdallaoui as part of our CSET classes at Thaddeus Stevens College.
